# NBA Player Performance Analysis Using Python
This project explores NBA player performance using data analysis and visualization techniques. It identifies the most efficient 3-point shooters by position, evaluates potential free-agent signings based on key metrics, and compares top performers across the league.
#### *Objectives:*
1. Determine which position is most efficient at shooting 3-pointers for each team.
2. Evaluate the potential for free-agent signings/trades by examining total points, assists, and rebounds.
3. Identify top players and compare key stats.

Dataset: NBA Player Stats (Kaggle)

The data was downloaded using the “Get Table as CSV (for Excel)” option, which embedded the Comma Separated Values (CSV) file directly into the webpage. Then, I copied, pasted, and saved the data into a Microsoft Notepad file, and loaded directly into Python.
